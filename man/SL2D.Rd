\title{
  Squared \eqn{L_{2}} Discrepancy Approach for Estimating the
  Solution to the Inverse Problem
}

\description{This function fits an SVD-based GP model on the
  training dataset \code{design} and response matrix \code{resp}, and
  minimizes the squared \eqn{L_{2}} discrepancy between the target
  response and the predicted mean of the SVD-based GP model on the
  test set \code{candidate} to estimate the solution to the inverse
  problem. It is a naive approach for estimating the solution provided
  in Chapter 4 of Zhang (2018).

\usage{
SL2D(design,resp,yobs,candidate,frac=.95,
     mtype=c("zmean","cmean","lmean"),
     gstart=0.0001)
}
\arguments{

  \item{design}{ An \eqn{N} by \eqn{d} matrix of \eqn{N}
    training/design inputs.}

  \item{resp}{ An \eqn{L} by \eqn{N} response matrix of \code{design},
    where \eqn{L} is the length of the time series outputs, \eqn{N} is
    the number of design points.}

  \item{yobs}{ A vector of length \eqn{L} of the time-series valued
    field observations or the target response.
  }

  \item{candidate}{ An \eqn{M} by \eqn{d} matrix of \eqn{M} candidate points
    on which the estimated solution to the inverse problem is extracted.
  }

  \item{frac}{
    The threshold in the cumulative percentage criterion to select the
    number of SVD bases. The default value is 0.95.
  }

  \item{mtype}{ The type of mean functions for the GP models. The choice
    "zmean" denotes zero-mean, "cmean" indicates constant-mean, "lmean" indicates
    linear-mean. The default choice is "zmean".
  }

  \item{gstart}{ The starting number and upper bound for estimating the
    nugget parameter. If \code{gstart = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)}, the
    nugget parameter will be fixed at \code{sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)},
    since \code{sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)} is the lower bound of the
    nugget term. The default value is 0.0001.} }

\value{
  \item{xhat}{The estimated solution to the inverse problem obtained from the
    candidate set \code{candidate}.}
}
